The aim is to have an extension loop, where there's a known path for a
replenisher creep to travel on (minimizes pathfinding), with an entry point
for new energy.

The maximum number of extensions a room will have is 60, plus 3 spawns.

There are a variety of different possible things to optimise for:
- total size used
- path finding efficiency
- ease of coding
- adaptability
